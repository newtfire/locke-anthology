      <p>This TEI customization describes a schema that includes <emph>all</emph> of the TEI P5
        modules. This is a very useful starting place for manually creating your own customizations
        â€” it is much easier to delete the modules you do not want than to add the modules you do.
        Furthermore this customization often proves helpful for testing TEI software.</p>
      <p>However, this particular TEI customization is <emph>not recommended</emph> for actual use
        for encoding documents. It produces schemas and reference documentation that will be much
        larger and include many more elements than almost anyone could conceivably ever need.
        Tempting though it may be simply to have absolutely everything, and <q>just ignore</q>
        elements not required, experience has shown that their presence makes the documentation
        harder to read and use, and makes a schema that is far more lax than desired.</p>
      <p>The <att>n</att> attribute of each <gi>moduleRef</gi> below reflects the chapter number of
        the TEI <title>Guidelines</title> in which the module being referenced is defined. Note that
        the modules are generally referred to in the order defined, with the exception that the
        module for <title level="a">Simple Analytic Mechanisms</title> is referred to before the
        module for <title level="a">Dictionaries</title>. This is because the class <name type="class">att.lexicographic.normalized</name> (which is defined in <name type="module">analysis</name>) needs to be specified before the class <name type="class">att.lexicographic</name> (which is defined in <name type="module">dictionaries</name>).</p>
      <p>The first four modules are often called the <soCalled>required</soCalled> modules. However,
        these modules are not themselves technically required to create a TEI conformant markup
        language (let alone a useful non-TEI conformant markup language). Rather, they each contain
        one or more <emph>elements</emph> which are required for TEI conformance.</p>
