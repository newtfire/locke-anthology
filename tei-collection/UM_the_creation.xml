            <head>THE CREATION</head>
            <l enjamb="no">A Negro Sermon</l>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="no">And <name>God</name> stepped out on space,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And He looked around and said,</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">
                  <said>“I'm lonely</said>
               </l>
               <l enjamb="no">
                  <said>I'll make me a world.”</said>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="yes">And as far as the eye of <name>God</name> could see</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Darkness covered everything,</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">Blacker than a hundred midnights</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Down in a cypress swamp.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="no">Then God smiled,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And the light broke,</l>
            </lg>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="no">And the darkness rolled up on one side,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And the light stood shining on the other,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And <name>God</name> said, <said>“That's good!"</said>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="no">Then <name>God</name> reached out and took the light in His hands,</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">And <name>God</name> rolled the light around in His hands</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Until He made the sun;</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And He set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">And the light that was left from making the sun</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">
                  <name>God</name> gathered it up in a shining ball</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And flung it against the darkness,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Spangling the night with the moon and stars.</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">Then down between</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">The darkness and the light</l>
               <l enjamb="no">He hurled the world;</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And <name>God</name> said, <said>“That's good,"</said>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="no">Then <name>God</name> Himself stepped down—</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">And the sun was on His right hand</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And the moon was on His left;</l>
               <l enjamb="no">The stars were clustered about His head,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And the earth was under His feet.</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">And <name>God</name> walked, and where He trod</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">His footsteps hollowed the valleys out</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And bulged the mountains up.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="yes">Then He stopped and looked, and saw</l>
               <l enjamb="no">That the <placeName>earth</placeName> was hot and barren.</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">So <name>God</name> stepped over to the edge of the world</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And He spat out the seven seas;</l>
               <l enjamb="no">He batted His eyes, and the lightnings flashed;</l>
               <l enjamb="no">He clapped His hands, and the thunders rolled;</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And the waters above the earth came down,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">The cooling waters came down.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="no">Then the green grass sprouted,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And the little red flowers blossomed,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And the oak spread out his arms,</l>
            </lg>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="no">And the lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And the rivers ran to the sea;</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And <name>God</name> smiled again,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And the rainbow appeared,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And curled itself around His shoulder.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="no">Then <name>God</name> raised His arm and He waved His hand,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Over the sea and over the land,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And He said, <said>“Bring forth. Bring forth.”</said>
               </l>
               <l enjamb="yes">And quicker than <name>God</name> could drop His hand</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">Fishes and fowls</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">And beasts and birds</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Swam the rivers and the seas,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Roamed the forests and the woods,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And split the air with their wings.</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And <name>God</name> said, <said>“That's good.”</said>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="no">Then <name>God</name> walked around,</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">And <name>God</name> looked around</l>
               <l enjamb="no">On all that He had made.</l>
               <l enjamb="no">He looked at His sun,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And He looked at His moon,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And He looked at His little stars;</l>
               <l enjamb="no">He looked on His world,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">With all its living things,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And <name>God</name> said, <said>“I'm lonely still.”</said>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="yes">Then <name>God</name> sat down</l>
               <l enjamb="no">On the side of a hill where He could think;</l>
               <l enjamb="no">By a deep, wide river He sat down;</l>
               <l enjamb="no">With His head in His hands,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">
                  <name>God</name> thought and thought,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Till He thought, <said>“I'll make me a man.”</said>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="yes">Up from the bed of a river</l>
               <l enjamb="no">
                  <name>God</name> scooped the clay;</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">And by the bank of the river</l>
               <l enjamb="no">He kneeled Him down;</l>
            </lg>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="yes">And there the great <name>God</name> Almighty</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Who rounded the earth in the middle of His hand;</l>
               <l enjamb="no">This Great <name>God</name>,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Like a mammy bending over her baby,</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">Kneeled down in the dust</l>
               <l enjamb="yes">Toiling over a lump of clay</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Till He shaped it in His own image;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l enjamb="no">Then into it He blew the breath of life,</l>
               <l enjamb="no">And man became a living soul.</l>
               <l enjamb="no">Amen. Amen.</l>
