“An Earth Song” By Langston Hughes
Pg. 142, Third Page

An Earth Song

It’s an earth song,—
And I’ve been waiting long for an earth song.
It’s a spring song,—
And I’ve been waiting long for a spring song.
Strong as the shoots of a new plant
Strong as the bursting of new buds
Strong as the coming of the first child from its mother’s
womb.
It’s an earth song,
A body-song,
A spring song,—
I have been waiting long for this spring song.
