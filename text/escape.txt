“Escape” By Georgia Douglas Johnson
Pg. 147, Half Page

Escape

Shadows, shadows,
Hug me round
So that I shall not be found
By sorrow:
She pursues me
Everywhere,
I can’t lose her
Anywhere.

Fold me in your black
Abyss,
She will never look
In this,—
Shadows, shadows,
Hug me round
In your solitude
Profound.

	-Georgia Douglas Johnson
