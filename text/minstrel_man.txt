“Minstrel Man” By Langston Hughes
Pg. 144, Half Page

Minstrel Man

Because my mouth
Is wide with laughter
And my throat Is
deep with song,
You do not think
I suffer after
I have held my pain
So long.

Because my mouth
Is wide with laughter,
You do not hear
My inner cry,
Because my feet
Are gay with dancing,
You do not know
I die.

	-Langston Hughes
