“I Too” By Langston Hughes
Pg. 145, Half Page

I Too

I, too, sing America.

I am the darker brother.
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes.
But I laugh,
And eat well,
And grow strong.

To-morrow
I’ll sit at the table
When company comes
Nobody ’ll dare
Say to me,
“Eat in the kitchen”
Then.

Besides, they’ll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed,—

I, too, am America.
