                <p class="caption_p_small">Throughout our project, our code has gone through several transformations.
                    Strictly talking about our TEI code, it first started out as these very basic
                    templates that contained the poems found within the Anthology. These templates
                    were then sent out to the Harlem Renaissance class at Framingham University.
                    Their class marked up the poem templates looking for rhyme patterns, literary
                    devices, and themes. Once they were finished marking up the poems, they were
                    sent back to us. We realized that some of the poems had a unique way that they
                    were marked up, so we had to come up with a way to standardize the markup. We
                    wrote an XSLT script that matched onto the most common mark up and changed them
                    all to the same thing. The XSLT script got the bulk of the job done, but we
                    would have to go over each poem to make sure they were all of good quality. At
                    this point, the TEI would be complete.</p>

                    <figcaption>This is what the mark up looked like when we first recieved Framingham's TEI "package." As you can see, they used the rs element to hold
                    attribute values, like type, to mark up the poems.</figcaption>

                <h4 class="h4_title">--About Our Code: MEI--</h4>
                <p class="caption_p_small">One aspect of the project was coding the pieces of music found throughout the anthology.
                To do this we used MEI or Music Encoding Initiative, and MEICO to convert the code into MDID and WAV formats.</p>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/mei_example.PNG" alt="MEI example: Father Abraham"/>
                    <figcaption>MEI code for "Father Abraham Tell It"</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p class="caption_p_small">In this example you can see that each meausre is marked with a meause element and given a number. If you have numberous staffs in a piece of music you would 
                use a staff element, in the header you are able to create each staff and determine the key and if the staff is G clef or F clef. When you want to create a note you use the note element, and you can use 
                attributes to determine the note, octave, and duration. In the note element you can also mark if the note has a tie or a dot associated with it. These note elements can also be grouped into a chord element 
                or a beam element.</p>

                <p class="caption_p_small">To converte the MEI code into playable audio we used a software called MEICO. To use it you can add the MEI code you want to convert and the schema associated with it. 
                If the code is well formed you will be able to convert it into formats such as MIDI, WAV, MP3 and more.</p>
