                <h4>--About Our Code: TEI--</h4>
                <p>Throughout our project, our code has gone through several transformations.
                    Strictly talking about our TEI code, it first started out as these very basic
                    templates that contained the poems found within the Anthology. These templates
                    were then sent out to the Harlem Renaissance class at Framingham University.
                    Their class marked up the poem templates looking for rhyme patterns, literary
                    devices, and themes. Once they were finished marking up the poems, they were
                    sent back to us. We realized that some of the poems had a unique way that they
                    were marked up, so we had to come up with a way to standardize the markup. We
                    wrote an XSLT script that matched onto the most common mark up and changed them
                    all to the same thing. The XSLT script got the bulk of the job done, but we
                    would have to go over each poem to make sure they were all of good quality. At
                    this point, the TEI would be complete.</p>

                    <figcaption>This is what the mark up looked like when we first recieved Framingham's TEI "package." As you can see, they used the rs element to hold
                    attribute values, like type, to mark up the poems.</figcaption>
