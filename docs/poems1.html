      <h2>"AN EARTH SONG"</h2>
      
      <p>
         It’s an earth song,
         And I’ve been waiting long for an earth song.
         It’s a spring song,—
         And I’ve been waiting long for a spring song.
         Strong as the shoots of a new plant
         Strong as the bursting of new buds
         Strong as the coming of the first child from its mother’s
         womb.
         It’s an earth song,
         A body-song,
         A spring song,—
         I have been waiting long for this spring song.

      <h2>"FRUIT OF THE FLOWER"</h2>
      
      
      <p>
         My father is a quiet man
         With sober, steady ways;
         For simile, a folded fan;
         His nights are like his days.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         My mother’s life is puritan,
         No hint of cavalier,
         A pool so calm you’re sure it can
         Have little depth to fear.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         And yet my father’s eyes can boast
         How full his life has been;
         There haunts them yet the languid ghost
         Of some still sacred sin.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         And though my mother chants of God,
         And of the mystic river,
         I’ve seen a bit of checkered sod
         Set all her flesh aquiver.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Why should he deem it pure mischance
         A son of his is fain
         To do a naked tribal dance
         Each time he hears the rain?
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Why should she think it devil’s art
         That all my songs should be
         Of love and lovers, broken heart,
         And wild sweet agony?
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Who plants a seed begets a bud,
         Extract of that same root;
         Why marvel at the hectic blood
         That flushes this wild fruit?

      <h2>“In Memory Of Colonel Charles Young”</h2>
      
      
      
      
      
      Along the shore the tall, thin grass
      That fringes that dark river,
      While sinuously soft feet pass,
      Begins to bleed and quiver.
      
      The great dark voice breaks with a sob
      Across the womb of night;
      Above your grave the tom-toms throb,
      And the hills are weird with light.
      
      The great dark heart is like a well
      Drained bitter by the sky,
      And all the honeyed lies they tell
      Come there to thirst and die.
      
      No lie is strong enough to kill
      The roots that work below;
      From your rich dust and slaughtered will
      A tree with tongues will grow.

         With swords upon this hill,
         It is not wise to waste the life
         Against a stubborn will.
         Yet would we die as some have done.
         Beating a way for the rising sun.

      <h2>THE CREATION</h2>
      
      A Negro Sermon
      
      
      <p>
         And God stepped out on space,
         And He looked around and said,
         “I'm lonely
         I'll make me a world.”
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         And as far as the eye of God could see
         Darkness covered everything,
         Blacker than a hundred midnights
         Down in a cypress swamp.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Then God smiled,
         And the light broke,
         </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         And the darkness rolled up on one side,
         And the light stood shining on the other,
         And God said, “That's good!"
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Then God reached out and took the light in His hands,
         And God rolled the light around in His hands
         Until He made the sun;
         And He set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.
         And the light that was left from making the sun
         God gathered it up in a shining ball
         And flung it against the darkness,
         Spangling the night with the moon and stars.
         Then down between
         The darkness and the light
         He hurled the world;
         And God said, “That's good,"
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Then God Himself stepped down—
         And the sun was on His right hand
         And the moon was on His left;
         The stars were clustered about His head,
         And the earth was under His feet.
         And God walked, and where He trod
         His footsteps hollowed the valleys out
         And bulged the mountains up.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Then He stopped and looked, and saw
         That the earth was hot and barren.
         So God stepped over to the edge of the world
         And He spat out the seven seas;
         He batted His eyes, and the lightnings flashed;
         He clapped His hands, and the thunders rolled;
         And the waters above the earth came down,
         The cooling waters came down.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Then the green grass sprouted,
         And the little red flowers blossomed,
         The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,
         And the oak spread out his arms,
         </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         And the lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,
         And the rivers ran to the sea;
         And God smiled again,
         And the rainbow appeared,
         And curled itself around His shoulder.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Then God raised His arm and He waved His hand,
         Over the sea and over the land,
         And He said, “Bring forth. Bring forth.”
         And quicker than God could drop His hand
         Fishes and fowls
         And beasts and birds
         Swam the rivers and the seas,
         Roamed the forests and the woods,
         And split the air with their wings.
         And God said, “That's good.”
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Then God walked around,
         And God looked around
         On all that He had made.
         He looked at His sun,
         And He looked at His moon,
         And He looked at His little stars;
         He looked on His world,
         With all its living things,
         And God said, “I'm lonely still.”
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Then God sat down
         On the side of a hill where He could think;
         By a deep, wide river He sat down;
         With His head in His hands,
         God thought and thought,
         Till He thought, “I'll make me a man.”
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Up from the bed of a river
         God scooped the clay;
         And by the bank of the river
         He kneeled Him down;

         And there the great God Almighty
         Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky,
         Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,
         Who rounded the earth in the middle of His hand;
         This Great God,
         Like a mammy bending over her baby,
         Kneeled down in the dust
         Toiling over a lump of clay
         Till He shaped it in His own image;
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         Then into it He blew the breath of life,
         And man became a living soul.
         Amen. Amen.

      <h2>THE NEGRO SPEAKS OF RIVERS</h2>
      
      
      <p>
         I’ve known rivers . . .
         I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow
         of human blood in human veins.
         My soul has grown deep like the rivers.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young,
         I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep,
         I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         I heard the singing of the Mississippi when
         Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans,
         And I’ve seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset. 
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         I’ve known rivers:
         Ancient, dusky rivers,
         My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

      <h2>THE ORDEAL</h2>
      
      
      <p>
         Ho! my brother,
         Pass me not by so scornfully
         I’m doing this living of being black,
         Perhaps I bear your own life-pack,
         And heavy, heavy is the load
         That bends my body to the road.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         But I have kept a smile for fate,
         I neither cry, nor cringe, nor hate,
         Intrepidly, I strive to bear
         This handicap. The planets wear
         The Maker’s imprint, and with mine
         I swing into their rhythmic line;
         I ask—only for destiny,
         Mine, not thine.
         </p>

      <h2>WHITE HOUSES</h2>
      
      
      <p>
         Your door is shut against my tightened face,
         And I am sharp as steel with discontent;
         But I possess the courage and the grace
         To bear my anger proudly and unbent.
         The pavement slabs burn loose beneath my feet,
         A chafing savage, down the decent street,
         And passion rends my vitals as I pass,
         Where boldly shines your shuttered door of glass.
         Oh I must search for wisdom every hour,
         Deep in my wrathful bosom sore and raw,
         And find in it the superhuman power
         To hold me to the letter of your law!
         Oh I must keep my heart inviolate
         Against the potent poison of your hate.
         </p>

         We have to-morrow
         Bright before us
         Like a flame
         </p>
      
      <p>
         Yesterday, a night-gone thing
         A sun-down name
         </p>
      
      <p>
         And dawn to-day
         Broad arch above the road we came,
         We march!
