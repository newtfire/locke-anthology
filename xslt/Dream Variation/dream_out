      <h2>"DREAM VARIATION"</h2>
      
      <p>
         To fling my arms wide 7
         In some place of the sun,
         To whirl and to dance
         Till the bright day is done.
         Then rest at cool evening
         Beneath a tall tree
         While night comes gently
         Dark like me.
         That is my dream.
         To fling my arms wide
         In the face of the sun.
         Dance! Whirl! Whirl!
         Till the quick day is done.
         Rest at pale evening,
         A tall, slim tree,
         Night coming tenderly
         Black like me.
         </p>
