      <h2>"BAPTISM"</h2>
      
      <p>
         Into the furnace let me go alone;
         Stay you without in terror of the heat.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         I will go naked in—for thus ’tis sweet—
         Into the weird depths of the hottest zone.
         I will not quiver in the frailest bone,
         You will not note a flicker of defeat;
         My heart shall tremble not its fate to meet,
         Nor mouth give utterance to any moan.
         The yawning oven spits forth fiery spears;
         Red aspish tongues shout wordlessly my name.
         Desire destroys, consumes my mortal fears,
         Transforming me into a shape of flame.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         I will come out, back to your world of tears,
         A stronger soul within a finer frame.
         </p>
