      <h2>"AN EARTH SONG"</h2>
      
      <p>
         It’s an earth song,—
         And I’ve been waiting long for an earth song.
         It’s a spring song,—
         And I’ve been waiting long for a spring song.
         Strong as the shoots of a new plant
         Strong as the bursting of new buds
         Strong as the coming of the first child from its mother’s
         womb.
         It’s an earth song,
         A body-song,
         A spring song,—
         I have been waiting long for this spring song.
         </p>
