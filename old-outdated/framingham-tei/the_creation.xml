            <head> The Creation </head>
            <lg>
            <l>And <rs type="religion">God</rs> stepped out on space,</l>
            <l>And He looked around and said,</l>
            <l>“Pm lonely</l>
            <l>Pll make me a world.”</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And as far as the eye of <rs type="religion">God</rs> could see</l>
            <l>Darkness covered everything,</l>
            <l>Blacker than a hundred midnights</l>
            <l>Down in a cypress swamp.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then <rs type="religion">God</rs> smiled,</l>
            <l>And the light broke,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
            <l>And the darkness rolled up on one side,</l>
            <l>And the light stood shining on the other,</l>
               <l>And <rs type="religion">God</rs> said, “That's good!"</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then <rs type="religion">God</rs> reached out and took the light in His hands,</l>
               <l>And <rs type="religion">God</rs> rolled the light around in His hands</l>
               <l>Until He made the sun;</l>
               <l> And He set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.</l>
               <l>And the light that was left from making the sun</l>
               <l><rs type="religion">God</rs> gathered it up in a shining ball</l>
               <l> And flung it against the darkness,</l>
               <l>Spangling the night with the moon and stars.</l>
               <l>Then down between</l>
               <l>The darkness and the light</l>
               <l>He hurled the world;</l>
               <l>And <rs type="religion">God</rs> said, “That's good,"</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then <rs type="religion">God</rs> Himself stepped down—</l>
               <l>And the sun was on His right hand</l>
               <l> And the moon was on His left;</l>
               <l>The stars were clustered about His head,</l>
               <l>And the earth was under His feet.</l>
               <l>And <rs type="religion">God</rs> walked, and where He trod</l>
               <l>His footsteps hollowed the valleys out</l>
               <l> And bulged the mountains up.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then He stopped and looked, and saw</l>
               <l>That the earth was hot and barren.</l>
               <l>So <rs type="religion">God</rs> stepped over to the edge of the world</l>
               <l>And He spat out the seven seas;</l>
               <l>He batted His eyes, and the lightnings flashed;</l>
               <l>He clapped His hands, and the thunders rolled;</l>
               <l>And the waters above the earth came down,</l>
               <l>The cooling waters came down.</l>
            </lg>
            
            <lg>
               <l>Then the green grass sprouted,</l>
               <l>And the little red flowers blossomed,</l>
               <l>The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,</l>
               <l>And the oak spread out his arms,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And the lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,</l>
               <l>And the rivers ran to the sea;</l>
               <l>And <rs type="religion">God</rs> smiled again,</l>
               <l>And the rainbow appeared,</l>
               <l>And curled itself around His shoulder.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then <rs type="religion">God</rs> raised His arm and He waved His hand,</l>
               <l>Over the sea and over the land,</l>
               <l>And He said, “Bring forth. Bring forth.”</l>
               <l>And quicker than <rs type="religion">God</rs> could drop His hand</l>
               <l>Fishes and fowls</l>
               <l>And beasts and birds</l>
               <l>Swam the rivers and the seas,</l>
               <l>Roamed the forests and the woods,</l>
               <l>And split the air with their wings.</l>
               <l>And <rs type="religion">God</rs> said, “That's good.”</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then <rs type="religion">God</rs> walked around,</l>
               <l>And <rs type="religion">God</rs> looked around</l>
               <l>On all that He had made.</l>
               <l>He looked at His sun,</l>
               <l>And He looked at His moon,</l>
               <l>And He looked at His little stars;</l>
               <l>He looked on His world,</l>
               <l>With all its living things,</l>
               <l>And <rs type="religion">God</rs> said, “Pm lonely still.”</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then <rs type="religion">God</rs> sat down</l>
               <l>On the side of a hill where He could think;</l>
               <l>By a deep, wide river He sat down;</l>
               <l>With His head in His hands,</l>
               <l><rs type="religion">God</rs> thought and thought,</l>
               <l>Till He thought, “Pll make me a man.”</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Up from the bed of a river</l>
               <l><rs type="religion">God</rs> scooped the clay;</l>
               <l>And by the bank of the river</l>
               <l>He kneeled Him down;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And there the great <rs type="religion">God</rs> Almighty</l>
               <l>Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky,</l>
               <l>Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,</l>
               <l>Who rounded the earth in the middle of His hand;</l>
               <l>This Great <rs type="religion">God</rs>,</l>
               <l>Like a mammy bending over her baby,</l>
               <l>Kneeled down in the dust</l>
               <l>Toiling over a lump of clay</l>
               <l>Till He shaped it in His own image;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then into it He blew the breath of life,</l>
               <l>And man became a living soul.</l>
               <l>Amen. Amen.</l>
