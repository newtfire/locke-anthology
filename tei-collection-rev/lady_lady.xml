      <body>   (Descriptive poetry)
         Lady, Lady, I saw your face,
         Dark as night withholding a star . (These two stanzas are couplets) . .
         The chisel fell, or it might have been
         You had borne so long the yoke of men.
         (these two stanzas are couplets)
         Lady, Lady, I saw your hands,
         Twisted, awry- like crumpled roots,(metaphor)
         Bleached poor white in a sudsy tub,
         Wrinkled and drawn from your rub-a-dub. (tub and dub rhyme)
         (the four stanzas are a quatrain)
         Lady, Lady, I saw your heart,
         And altared there in its darksome place   (couplet)
         Were the tongues of flame the ancients knew,
         Where the good God sits to spangle through. (knew and through rhyme)
         (couplet) (repetition with lady lady, and also common theme)
